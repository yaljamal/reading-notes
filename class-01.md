### the Structure of the web site is :
- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
- CSS (cascading style sheets)

### html is languge for design a web page and its have a tages (characters that sit inside angled brackets) and i will mentioned them :
 > every page should have three tages : 
 1. `<head>`
 2. `<body>`
 3. `<foter> `

- `<img src="" alt="">` this tage to insert image 

- `<p>` its to make a paragraph
- its should have in the html pages  
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
